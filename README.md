CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED

RESPONSES

Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based onpredefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriateresponses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural

language processing and conversation flow.


we've created a simple rule-based chatbot in Python that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules using if-else statements 
and pattern matching techniques. This basic chatbot provides a foundational understanding of natural language processing and conversation flow,
demonstrating how to handle common user queries and provide appropriate responses.

While this chatbot is limited in its capabilities compared to more advanced models powered by machine learning and deep learning algorithms, 
it serves as a starting point for understanding the principles of building conversational agents. With further enhancements and integration of
more sophisticated techniques, such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and context understanding, we can develop more intelligent and 
versatile chatbots capable of handling a wider range of user interactions and providing more personalized responses.
